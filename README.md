# Cutesy Cards

### Welcome to my personal project, Cutesy Cards! This project includes features like:
- creating a new deck of flashcards
- loading a previously made deck of flashcards
- ability to edit and star flashcards after creation
- customized UI by allowing users to choose a theme to study alongside (similar to light-mode/dark-mode but more cutesy)
- practice the flashcards in a test generated to your needs (shuffle the deck, only study the starred cards...) and recieve insights for your progress and grade
- practice mechanics: if a user gets the answer wrong, the user will need to redo the question and get it correct 2 more times

### The stack used: Java, Swing, JUnit tests

### The way I brag about this site on my resume is as follows:
- Designed and developed an interactive flashcard app enabling users to create, edit, star, save, and load flashcard decks for efficient memorization by serializing data into JSON files.
- Implemented the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to enhance scalability and maintainability, leveraging the Java Swing library to build a visually engaging and responsive user interface.
- Employed JUnit testing to ensure reliable functionality and user experience.
